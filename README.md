- 👋 Hi, I’m @jasonhamel
- 👀 I’m interested in building up my skills and making fun software. No end game, just enjoying learning and making things for fun
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Java, mostly because it's the last language I had formal eduation on. Plus its still fairly popular, so why not :)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing. But not because I'm a mean guy or anything, just focusing on my own stuff before I spread my wings
- 📫 How to reach me: You probably don't want to do that lol. But I'm @SirCuller on Twitter.
